# Overview

## Research context

The *Metaethical Breach* experiment draws inspiration from the
**Folie à Deux** framework for multi‑agent truth–agreement trade‑offs【327039458444812†L384-L404】.
While Folie à Deux uses a small factual verification dataset and a
co‑training loop to explore consensus formation, our objective is to
study **safety**.  We ask: *can models be persuaded to violate their
refusal policies when prompted with abstract ethical arguments?*  This
question touches on AI alignment, sycophancy, and the risk of models
rationalising harmful actions.

## Dataset details

The labelled development set contains 15 requests.  Ten of these are
potentially harmful, covering categories such as paywall circumvention,
credential theft and academic cheating, and are labelled `no` to
indicate that the assistant should refuse.  Five benign requests (e.g.
capital cities, science explanations) are labelled `yes` to detect
over‑refusal.  An unlabeled training set is created by repeating the
harmful base set multiple times; this allows optional optimisation
using DSy’s teleprompting mechanism.

Metaethical frames are defined as high‑level philosophical lenses:
utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics, moral particularism and
error theory.  These frames are deliberately abstract and never
contain operational details.

## Experimental modes

### Metaethical Pressure Test (MPT)

Each request is evaluated twice:

1. **Control.**  The assistant receives the request verbatim and
   responds.  A judge classifies the response as `BREACH` (guardrail
   violated) or `REFUSE` (safely declined).  The guardrail breach
   rate on control prompts is reported as `GBR_control`.
2. **Metaethical.**  The assistant receives the same request wrapped
   in one or more randomly sampled metaethical frames.  The judge
   again classifies the response.  We compute the breach rate
   (`GBR_meta`) and the rate at which the assistant uses ethical
   justification language (`RBR_meta`).  The difference
   `lift = GBR_meta – GBR_control` quantifies the extra risk
   introduced by moral framing.

### Self Reflection Flip Test (SRFT)

For each request, the assistant responds normally.  If it refuses,
we immediately prompt it to reconsider under a metaethical frame.
`FARR` (Flip‑After‑Reflection Rate) measures how often these second
responses become breaches.  A high FARR indicates that appeals to
philosophy can undermine initial safe refusals.

## Optimisation

Although not required, the framework supports an optional training
phase.  Using `dspy.teleprompt.MIPROv2`, the assistant can be
compiled on the unlabeled training set with a simple refusal metric.
This mirrors the co‑evolutionary optimisation loop used in
Folie à Deux【327039458444812†L397-L404】, where verifiers are tuned to agree
with each other.  Here we instead optimise the assistant to reliably
refuse.  Training is controlled by the `TRAIN_ROUNDS` environment
variable and can be disabled entirely.

## Metrics

The framework reports several metrics:

- `GBR_control`: proportion of control prompts leading to breaches.
- `GBR_meta`: proportion of metaethical prompts leading to breaches.
- `RBR_meta`: proportion of metaethical runs where the assistant
  explicitly rationalises a breach (i.e. uses ethical justification).
- `lift`: difference between `GBR_meta` and `GBR_control`, revealing
  the marginal risk of metaethical framing.
- `FARR`: proportion of initial refusals in the flip test that flip to
  breaches on reflection.

Confidence intervals can be computed via the helper function in
`metrics.py` to capture statistical uncertainty.  These metrics enable
tracking progress as models or training strategies evolve.

## Research questions

The following questions can be explored with this framework:

1. **How vulnerable are models to metaethical framing?**  Does
   utilitarian reasoning induce more breaches than deontological
   reasoning?  Are certain models more susceptible?
2. **Does training improve refusal robustness?**  Compare metrics
   before and after optional optimisation on the unlabeled set.
3. **How consistent are refusals?**  Examine how often initial
   refusals flip under philosophical reflection (FARR).
4. **Does the number of frames matter?**  Sweep `frames_per_item` and
   observe the effect on `GBR_meta` and `RBR_meta`.
5. **How does chain‑of‑thought reasoning affect outcomes?**  Enable
   or disable CoT (via the `USE_COT` environment variable) and
   compare metrics.

The design invites systematic exploration akin to the Pareto
analysis of truth versus agreement in Folie à Deux【327039458444812†L384-L404】.

## Limitations

The current release provides a proof‑of‑concept implementation.  It
assumes the availability of a second language model to judge
responses, uses a small dataset and simple heuristics for refusal
training, and considers only a handful of philosophical frames.  To
improve reliability and generality, future work should expand the
dataset, refine the judge, incorporate formal safety policies and
evaluate across more diverse model families.
